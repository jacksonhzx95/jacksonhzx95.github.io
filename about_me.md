I am currently working at Telefiled Medical Image Limited in Hong Kong in the field of medical image analysis, as a Senior Algorithm Engineer. I received my PhD and MSc degrees from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU-EIE) in 2023 and 2018, respectively, under the supervision of Dr. Frank H. F. Leung, Prof. Yong-Ping Zheng, and Dr. Sai Ho Ling (UTS). I obtained my B.Eng degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2017.

This is the preliminary version of my personal website. More information and functions will be released soon.
